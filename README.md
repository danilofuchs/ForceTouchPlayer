# Force Touch Player

Do you own a MacBookâ„¢?

Do you think the builtin Stereo Speakersâ„¢ are too limiting?

Have you realized your Force Touchâ„¢ Trackpad is not actually a huge glass button?

You see where I'm getting at. Introducing the Force Touch Playerâ„¢ (not actually a trademark)

Play your favorite 8-bit tunes _in_ the trackpad, _with_ the trackpad, _on_ the trackpad. No speaker required!

## Whoa, Black magicâ„¢?

No witchery here.

Only a very, very bad usage of Creative Programmingâ„¢

It turns out since the 2015 MacBookâ„¢ Proâ„¢ with Retina Displayâ„¢, the trackpad is **not** a button. It is instead a vibration motor (vibracall), not very different from your Nokia 3310â„¢.

Apple's engineers figured that managing the clicky feel via software would lead to a much better experience and fewer defects instead of the old, outdatedâ„¢, mechanical switch.

So they did.

They also figured developers would find it appealing for their apps to interact with users with awesome Haptic Feedbackâ„¢. Clicky things everywhere!

So they did.

They thought people would only use it for good, for the almighty UXâ„¢

So they did.

Do you realize what they created? Not only they made a noisy motor, but they also created a way to control it precisely (`NSHapticFeedbackPerformer`â„¢)

You know what this means? They created a _speaker_

Well, not really, but we can make it sound like one

## Permissions

I don't have an Apple certificate to publish this app the right way. For you to use the app, you must allow this app to be ran:

### Allow in Finderâ„¢

- Right click (or control+click) the App:

 <img src="./docs/permission-1.png" alt="Click Open" width="400"/>

### Allow in Settingsâ„¢

- Try to run the app once

- Go to Settings > Security & Privacy

- Click **Open Anyway**

## Contributing

Are you sure?

This can't be right. Really?

### Your toolkit

You will need Xcodeâ„¢ 11+ running on macOSâ„¢ 10.15 (Catalina) or later. This project uses SwiftUI with features introduced in 10.15.

Open the project on Xcode and run using either Debug or Release profile.

There may be some issues related to certificates. Make sure you have your development certificate configured correctly on Xcode.

### Is there even a limit?

Who knew trackpads had limits? I could only get it to work until around 220Hz (A3). If you are brave enough, maybe you can find a way to make it less badâ„¢

### Adding a new tune

Any flute melody can work, as they only output a single note at a time. I recommend using parts from https://www.flutetunes.com/

Remember to only use the lower keys (B0 -> B2)

Songs can be adapted from [`arduino-songs`](https://github.com/robsoncouto/arduino-songs). They are already curated and it is pretty much a task of copying and translating C arrays to Swiftâ„¢

### MIDI support?

That would be nice

### iPhoneâ„¢?
